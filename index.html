<h3 id="first-blog"> In the beggining</h3>

<p> It's been a slow evening of learning, I want to get the basics of HTML down before I start getting ahead of myself. At the minute I can't figure out how to center an Image. I read a 'how to' from W3Schools, but I coulnd't get it to work. Plan for tomorrow's blog:<br><br>* Change font-style of some of the text<br>* center the image!<br>* Maybe add some more css... <br><br> I'll keep you posted.
